# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide will be used throughout the Bootcamp to make notes and to keep an easy track of the information used throughout the course.

## Installation

"N/A"

## Usage
you can write about how each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. For now, we don't need to add an image, so you can delete that part.
